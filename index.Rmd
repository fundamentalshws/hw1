code for opening a file from a url (file in Excel), name it 'fragility23'?

```{r}
# opening a file from a url (file in Excel), name it 'fragility23'
linkGit="https://github.com/DACSS-Fundamentals/overview/raw/refs/heads/main/FSI-2023-DOWNLOAD.xlsx"

```

```{r}
#install.packages('rio')
library(rio) # package needed
fragility23=rio::import(file = linkGit) #object that will hold the result

```



# exploratory commands

find out column names in 'fragility23'?

Check the data types in df?

show me the first 10 rows?

show me the last 10 rows?

# transformative commands

## subsetting

keep some columns:
Country, Total,
S1: Demographic Pressures,
P1: State Legitimacy,
E2: Economic Inequality into object 'frag23_sub'

## renaming

rename 'frag23_sub' columns, keep var codes  only

## filtering

get me the top ten best countries on the  'E2'  measure from 'frag23_sub'

# some computations

give the statistical description of "frag23_sub"

the value of the worst quartile in Total

show correlations between "S1","E2", "P1"

regress P1 and E2 on S1

# some plotting

give me a plot for the 'P1' variable

visual correlation between S1 and E2

visual of the regression P1 and E2 on S1
